    "# Finding Open Access versions of articles in *Australian Historical Studies*\n",
    "\n",
    "Open access isn't just what historians expect from GLAM organisations, it's we do with the products of our research. [*Australian Historical Studies*](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rahs20/current) is one of the major journals for Australian historians. How much of it is accessible to researchers without the luxury of an institutional subscription?\n",
    "\n",
    "AHS is published by Taylor & Francis, and under their terms and conditions there are two ways articles can be made openly accessible:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The author can pay an article publishing charge (APC) to make the article open immediately upon publication. The APC is currently set at $3775. This is known as **Gold** Open Access.\n",
    "* The author can share the Author Accepted Manuscript (AAM) version of their article. The AAM version is the one after peer-review, but before copy-editing and typesetting. This version can be shared immediately on the author's personal website or, after an 18 month embargo, it can be uploaded to an institutional or subject repository. This is known as **Green** Open Access.\n",
    "\n",
    "If Green Open Access versions are uploaded to a recognised repository, they become findable. Tools such as the [Open Access Button](https://openaccessbutton.org/) and [Unpaywall](https://unpaywall.org/) can redirect you from a paywalled version to an open access alternative. If you use Zotero to save articles from a journal, it'll automatically look for Open Access versions via Unpaywall if no free downloads are available. Green Open Access costs nothing, but it opens your work to new audiences and new uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how many authors are taking advantage of Green Open Access arrangements? Let's have a look and see.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "For this little experiment I'm going to look at 10 years of articles, from 2008 to 2018. I'm finishing in 2018 because it's outside of the 18 month embargo period. Everything published in 2018 or before **can be made open access**. I'm focusing on research articles, excluding editorials, reviews, and commentaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "My plan is to save details of the articles to Zotero, access the details from the Zotero API, then use the Open Access Button API to look for open access versions."

These are described as 'free access' articles, rather then 'open access' articles which have the orange, open padlock icon. The difference is that Open Access articles are both freely available, **and** openly licensed. I don't know why the journal makes some articles 'free'. I did some checking and found that the 'free' articles don't seem to show up in the open access databases. In order to include them with the OA articles, I manually added the 'free' article link to Zotero. As you'll see below, I check for this link before searching for an OA version of each article. So the final results are a combination of the 'free' and OA articles."

While men were coming under increasing pressure to be stoic or tough I argue that this made sentimental songs more important rather than less, as a forum in which men could voice feelings considered unacceptable at other times in their lives.\", \"publicationTitle\": \"Australian Historical Studies\", \"volume\": \"43\", \"issue\": \"3\", \"pages\": \"412-428\", \"date\": \"September 1, 2012\", \"series\": \"\", \"seriesTitle\": \"\", \"seriesText\": \"\", \"journalAbbreviation\": \"\", \"language\": \"\", \"DOI\": \"10.1080/1031461X.2012.706619\", \"ISSN\": \"1031-461X\", \"shortTitle\": \"Australian Masculinities and Popular Song\", \"url\": \"https://doi.org/10.1080/1031461X.2012.706619\", \"accessDate\": \"2020-10-19T05:08:11Z\", \"archive\": \"\", \"archiveLocation\": \"\", \"libraryCatalog\": \"Taylor and Francis+NEJM\", \"callNumber\": \"\", \"rights\": \"\", \"extra\": \"Publisher: Routledge\\n_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/1031461X.2012.706619\", \"tags\": [], \"collections\": [\"922CMTJU\"], \"relations\": {}, \"dateAdded\": \"2020-10-20T02:22:30Z\", \"dateModified\": \"2020-10-20T02:22:30Z\", \"oadoi\": \"$$$\", \"licence\": \"$$$\", \"oa_type\": \"$$$\", \"year\": 2012}, {\"key\": \"MIUVFKR2\", \"version\": 12, \"itemType\": \"journalArticle\", \"title\": \"Australian Responses to the Indian Famine, 1876\\u201378: Sympathy, Photography and the British Empire\", \"creators\": [{\"creatorType\": \"author\", \"firstName\": \"Christina\", \"lastName\": \"Twomey\"}, {\"creatorType\": \"author\", \"firstName\": \"Andrew J.\", \"lastName\": \"May\"}], \"abstractNote\": \"This article analyses Australian efforts on behalf of victims of the 1876\\u20138 Indian famine as complex articulations of colonial identity and loyalty in the British imperial world.

This article traces the obscure history of this process through the first half of the twentieth century, posing questions about its implications for our historical understandings of race and assimilation.\", \"publicationTitle\": \"Australian Historical Studies\", \"volume\": \"44\", \"issue\": \"2\", \"pages\": \"206-226\", \"date\": \"June 1, 2013\", \"series\": \"\", \"seriesTitle\": \"\", \"seriesText\": \"\", \"journalAbbreviation\": \"\", \"language\": \"\", \"DOI\": \"10.1080/1031461X.2013.791707\", \"ISSN\": \"1031-461X\", \"shortTitle\": \"Conditional Inclusion\", \"url\": \"https://doi.org/10.1080/1031461X.2013.791707\", \"accessDate\": \"2020-10-19T05:22:06Z\", \"archive\": \"\", \"archiveLocation\": \"\", \"libraryCatalog\": \"Taylor and Francis+NEJM\", \"callNumber\": \"\", \"rights\": \"\", \"extra\": \"Publisher: Routledge\\n_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/1031461X.2013.791707\", \"tags\": [], \"collections\": [\"922CMTJU\"], \"relations\": {}, \"dateAdded\": \"2020-10-20T02:22:30Z\", \"dateModified\": \"2020-10-20T02:22:30Z\", \"oadoi\": \"$$$\", \"licence\": \"$$$\", \"oa_type\": \"$$$\", \"year\": 2013}, {\"key\": \"TE4XELYC\", \"version\": 8, \"itemType\": \"journalArticle\", \"title\": \"Containing Contention: A Reinterpretation of Democratic Change and Electoral Reform in the Australian Colonies\", \"creators\": [{\"creatorType\": \"author\", \"firstName\": \"Sean\", \"lastName\": \"Scalmer\"}], \"abstractNote\": \"Australia was a precocious mass democracy.

In particular, this essay explores VOC strategic emotional display, their interpretation of indigenous peoples' feelings and the varied narratives of these experiences and ideas in Company records.

The article argues that we should be wary about the origins of these sentimental stories, and about their capacity to be reworked into acts of historical recovery.\", \"publicationTitle\": \"Australian Historical Studies\", \"volume\": \"43\", \"issue\": \"3\", \"pages\": \"341-362\", \"date\": \"September 1, 2012\", \"series\": \"\", \"seriesTitle\": \"\", \"seriesText\": \"\", \"journalAbbreviation\": \"\", \"language\": \"\", \"DOI\": \"10.1080/1031461X.2012.706627\", \"ISSN\": \"1031-461X\", \"shortTitle\": \"Girl in a Red Dress\", \"url\": \"https://doi.org/10.1080/1031461X.2012.706627\", \"accessDate\": \"2020-10-19T05:08:08Z\", \"archive\": \"\", \"archiveLocation\": \"\", \"libraryCatalog\": \"Taylor and Francis+NEJM\", \"callNumber\": \"\", \"rights\": \"\", \"extra\": \"Publisher: Routledge\\n_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/1031461X.2012.706627\", \"tags\": [], \"collections\": [\"922CMTJU\"], \"relations\": {}, \"dateAdded\": \"2020-10-20T02:22:30Z\", \"dateModified\": \"2020-10-20T02:22:30Z\", \"oadoi\": \"$$$\", \"licence\": \"$$$\", \"oa_type\": \"$$$\", \"year\": 2012}, {\"key\": \"MZSNPJFX\", \"version\": 16, \"itemType\": \"journalArticle\", \"title\": \"Governing Nature: The Problem of Northern Australia\", \"creators\": [{\"creatorType\": \"author\", \"firstName\": \"Dr Sarah\", \"lastName\": \"Irving\"}], \"abstractNote\": \"Scholars have explored the history of attitudes toward northern Australia primarily in the context of the White Australia policy and its implications for the troubling human diversity of the north.

When the Supreme Courts of those colonies ruled in their favour, the self-governing colonials turned their minds to ever tighter restrictions through statutory reform. In this way, the White Australia Policy of the twentieth century might be considered the perverse product of Chinese litigation in colonial courts.

This article argues that, in the absence of any official policy responsibility in immigration matters, the Australian Department of Defence maintained a fervent commitment to the tenets of racial exclusivity contained at the heart of the White Australia policy from the mid-1950s to the early 1970s by discouraging Australian servicemen from entering into \\u2018Asian marriages\\u2019.\", \"publicationTitle\": \"Australian Historical Studies\", \"volume\": \"45\", \"issue\": \"2\", \"pages\": \"184-201\", \"date\": \"May 4, 2014\", \"series\": \"\", \"seriesTitle\": \"\", \"seriesText\": \"\", \"journalAbbreviation\": \"\", \"language\": \"\", \"DOI\": \"10.1080/1031461X.2014.911761\", \"ISSN\": \"1031-461X\", \"shortTitle\": \"In Defence of White Australia\", \"url\": \"https://doi.org/10.1080/1031461X.2014.911761\", \"accessDate\": \"2020-10-19T05:32:16Z\", \"archive\": \"\", \"archiveLocation\": \"\", \"libraryCatalog\": \"Taylor and Francis+NEJM\", \"callNumber\": \"\", \"rights\": \"\", \"extra\": \"Publisher: Routledge\\n_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/1031461X.2014.911761\", \"tags\": [], \"collections\": [\"922CMTJU\"], \"relations\": {}, \"dateAdded\": \"2020-10-20T02:22:30Z\", \"dateModified\": \"2020-10-20T02:22:30Z\", \"oadoi\": \"$$$\", \"licence\": \"$$$\", \"oa_type\": \"$$$\", \"year\": 2014}, {\"key\": \"LTITAVUN\", \"version\": 18, \"itemType\": \"journalArticle\", \"title\": \"\\u2018In the Backblocks of Capitalism\\u2019: Australian Student Activism in the Global 1960s\", \"creators\": [{\"creatorType\": \"author\", \"firstName\": \"Kate\", \"lastName\": \"Murphy\"}], \"abstractNote\": \"Recent histories of 1960s \\u2018student power\\u2019 in Europe and elsewhere have embraced the transnational turn, investigating cross-border connections between student groups and the diffusion of protest frames and styles.

I argue that while such imagery popularised reform and mobilised international support, recognition of Indigenous suffering was also heavily conditional upon its representation within conventional interpretive frameworks, as popular moral sensibilities allowed certain images, scandalous but familiar, to become the visual battleground of injustice.\", \"publicationTitle\": \"Australian Historical Studies\", \"volume\": \"43\", \"issue\": \"2\", \"pages\": \"210-232\", \"date\": \"June 1, 2012\", \"series\": \"\", \"seriesTitle\": \"\", \"seriesText\": \"\", \"journalAbbreviation\": \"\", \"language\": \"\", \"DOI\": \"10.1080/1031461X.2012.662938\", \"ISSN\": \"1031-461X\", \"shortTitle\": \"Photography and the Recognition of Indigenous Australians\", \"url\": \"https://doi.org/10.1080/1031461X.2012.662938\", \"accessDate\": \"2020-10-19T05:10:33Z\", \"archive\": \"\", \"archiveLocation\": \"\", \"libraryCatalog\": \"Taylor and Francis+NEJM\", \"callNumber\": \"\", \"rights\": \"\", \"extra\": \"Publisher: Routledge\\n_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/1031461X.2012.662938\", \"tags\": [], \"collections\": [\"922CMTJU\"], \"relations\": {}, \"dateAdded\": \"2020-10-20T02:22:30Z\", \"dateModified\": \"2020-10-20T02:22:30Z\", \"oadoi\": \"$$$\", \"licence\": \"$$$\", \"oa_type\": \"$$$\", \"year\": 2012}, {\"key\": \"P8WXPQ7M\", \"version\": 14, \"itemType\": \"journalArticle\", \"title\": \"Pointers to the Future of Family History\", \"creators\": [{\"creatorType\": \"author\", \"firstName\": \"John\", \"lastName\": \"Rickard\"}], \"abstractNote\": \"\", \"publicationTitle\": \"Australian Historical Studies\", \"volume\": \"44\", \"issue\": \"3\", \"pages\": \"457-462\", \"date\": \"September 1, 2013\", \"series\": \"\", \"seriesTitle\": \"\", \"seriesText\": \"\", \"journalAbbreviation\": \"\", \"language\": \"\", \"DOI\": \"10.1080/1031461X.2013.817289\", \"ISSN\": \"1031-461X\", \"shortTitle\": \"\", \"url\": \"https://doi.org/10.1080/1031461X.2013.817289\", \"accessDate\": \"2020-10-19T05:19:32Z\", \"archive\": \"\", \"archiveLocation\": \"\", \"libraryCatalog\": \"Taylor and Francis+NEJM\", \"callNumber\": \"\", \"rights\": \"\", \"extra\": \"Publisher: Routledge\\n_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/1031461X.2013.817289\", \"tags\": [], \"collections\": [\"922CMTJU\"], \"relations\": {}, \"dateAdded\": \"2020-10-20T02:22:30Z\", \"dateModified\": \"2020-10-20T02:22:30Z\", \"oadoi\": \"$$$\", \"licence\": \"$$$\", \"oa_type\": \"$$$\", \"year\": 2013}, {\"key\": \"6JWGL7QS\", \"version\": 26, \"itemType\": \"journalArticle\", \"title\": \"Policy Narratives in Historical Transition: A Case Study in Contemporary History\", \"creators\": [{\"creatorType\": \"author\", \"firstName\": \"James\", \"lastName\": \"Walter\"}, {\"creatorType\": \"author\", \"firstName\": \"Carolyn\", \"lastName\": \"Holbrook\"}], \"abstractNote\": \"Discontent about contemporary politics in Australia has been accompanied by a history in which the 1980s and 1990s are represented as a \\u2018golden era\\u2019 of policy reform.

This article observes a handful of these arrivals and departures, when Sydney was both a destination and transit city, while reflecting on the significance such narratives might have for understanding Australia's place on the edge of Pacific history.\", \"publicationTitle\": \"Australian Historical Studies\", \"volume\": \"46\", \"issue\": \"3\", \"pages\": \"340-355\", \"date\": \"September 2, 2015\", \"series\": \"\", \"seriesTitle\": \"\", \"seriesText\": \"\", \"journalAbbreviation\": \"\", \"language\": \"\", \"DOI\": \"10.1080/1031461X.2015.1076012\", \"ISSN\": \"1031-461X\", \"shortTitle\": \"Shadowing Imperial Networks\", \"url\": \"https://doi.org/10.1080/1031461X.2015.1076012\", \"accessDate\": \"2020-10-19T05:35:53Z\", \"archive\": \"\", \"archiveLocation\": \"\", \"libraryCatalog\": \"Taylor and Francis+NEJM\", \"callNumber\": \"\", \"rights\": \"\", \"extra\": \"Publisher: Routledge\\n_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/1031461X.2015.1076012\", \"tags\": [], \"collections\": [\"922CMTJU\"], \"relations\": {}, \"dateAdded\": \"2020-10-20T02:22:30Z\", \"dateModified\": \"2020-10-20T02:22:30Z\", \"oadoi\": \"$$$\", \"licence\": \"$$$\", \"oa_type\": \"$$$\", \"year\": 2015}, {\"key\": \"CAECLJXZ\", \"version\": 22, \"itemType\": \"journalArticle\", \"title\": \"Shifting Foundations: A Short History of Subversive Spaces on the Pioneer River\", \"creators\": [{\"creatorType\": \"author\", \"firstName\": \"Gabriella\", \"lastName\": \"Haynes\"}], \"abstractNote\": \"Scholars have acknowledged that terms such as \\u2018margin\\u2019 or \\u2018fringe\\u2019 do not encapsulate the spatial experience of excluded communities living in post-settlement Australia, yet there is only a small body of work on the detail and implications of these experiences.

More broadly, my aim is to reconsider prevailing views about the relationship between Australian manliness and sentimentality.

Seeing how the vocabularies of slavery and anti-slavery tracked through different colonial spaces reminds us of the uneven and intertwined histories that cut across and through the nineteenth-century world.\", \"publicationTitle\": \"Australian Historical Studies\", \"volume\": \"45\", \"issue\": \"1\", \"pages\": \"34-45\", \"date\": \"January 2, 2014\", \"series\": \"\", \"seriesTitle\": \"\", \"seriesText\": \"\", \"journalAbbreviation\": \"\", \"language\": \"\", \"DOI\": \"10.1080/1031461X.2013.877504\", \"ISSN\": \"1031-461X\", \"shortTitle\": \"Vocabularies of Slavery and Anti-Slavery\", \"url\": \"https://doi.org/10.1080/1031461X.2013.877504\", \"accessDate\": \"2020-10-19T05:33:53Z\", \"archive\": \"\", \"archiveLocation\": \"\", \"libraryCatalog\": \"Taylor and Francis+NEJM\", \"callNumber\": \"\", \"rights\": \"\", \"extra\": \"Publisher: Routledge\\n_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/1031461X.2013.877504\", \"tags\": [], \"collections\": [\"922CMTJU\"], \"relations\": {}, \"dateAdded\": \"2020-10-20T02:22:30Z\", \"dateModified\": \"2020-10-20T02:22:30Z\", \"oadoi\": \"$$$\", \"licence\": \"$$$\", \"oa_type\": \"$$$\", \"year\": 2014}, {\"key\": \"5TICX7FL\", \"version\": 3, \"itemType\": \"journalArticle\", \"title\": \"Voluntary Action, Social Welfare and the Australian Assistance Plan in the 1970s\", \"creators\": [{\"creatorType\": \"author\", \"firstName\": \"Melanie\", \"lastName\": \"Oppenheimer\"}], \"abstractNote\": \"The Australian Assistance Plan (AAP), a little-remembered yet radical and imaginative program of social welfare reform, was introduced by the Whitlam government in 1973 and abolished three years later by the Coalition government of Malcolm Fraser.

This theme of adaptation, we argue, is an instructive reflection of the legacies of Australia's convict past, but is not so well embodied by the successfully-nominated convict sites.

In the absence of conscription, that private decision-making was critical to the nature of Australia's commitment to the war, as men assessed and re-assessed the limits of obligation for themselves.\", \"publicationTitle\": \"Australian Historical Studies\", \"volume\": \"41\", \"issue\": \"2\", \"pages\": \"217-232\", \"date\": \"June 1, 2010\", \"series\": \"\", \"seriesTitle\": \"\", \"seriesText\": \"\", \"journalAbbreviation\": \"\", \"language\": \"\", \"ISSN\": \"1031-461X\", \"shortTitle\": \"Enlistment and Non-enlistment in Wartime Australia\", \"url\": \"https://doi.org/10.1080/10314611003713603\", \"accessDate\": \"2020-10-19T04:57:00Z\", \"archive\": \"\", \"archiveLocation\": \"\", \"libraryCatalog\": \"Taylor and Francis+NEJM\", \"callNumber\": \"\", \"rights\": \"\", \"extra\": \"Publisher: Routledge\\n_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/10314611003713603\", \"tags\": [], \"collections\": [\"922CMTJU\"], \"relations\": {}, \"dateAdded\": \"2020-10-20T02:22:30Z\", \"dateModified\": \"2020-10-20T02:22:30Z\", \"oadoi\": \"-\", \"licence\": \"-\", \"oa_type\": \"-\", \"year\": 2010}, {\"DOI\": \"10.1080/1031461X.2015.1035289\", \"title\": \"Environmental History, Australian Style\", \"trove_url\": \"https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/204405066\", \"link_type\": \"notonline\", \"repo_url\": \"https://hdl.handle.net/1885/98795\", \"key\": \"CUUXIRBM\", \"version\": 18, \"itemType\": \"journalArticle\", \"creators\": [{\"creatorType\": \"author\", \"firstName\": \"Tom\", \"lastName\": \"Griffiths\"}], \"abstractNote\": \"Australia has been a leader in the recent emergence of \\u2018the environmental humanities\\u2019.

Through a series of administrative procedures involving compulsory interviews, medical assessments and security checks, Australian military commanders employed a combination of pressure, intimidation and misinformation in their efforts to persuade Australian servicemen to abandon their plans to marry local Asian women. This article argues that, in the absence of any official policy responsibility in immigration matters, the Australian Department of Defence maintained a fervent commitment to the tenets of racial exclusivity contained at the heart of the White Australia policy from the mid-1950s to the early 1970s by discouraging Australian servicemen from entering into \\u2018Asian marriages\\u2019.\", \"publicationTitle\": \"Australian Historical Studies\", \"volume\": \"45\", \"issue\": \"2\", \"pages\": \"184-201\", \"date\": \"May 4, 2014\", \"series\": \"\", \"seriesTitle\": \"\", \"seriesText\": \"\", \"journalAbbreviation\": \"\", \"language\": \"\", \"ISSN\": \"1031-461X\", \"shortTitle\": \"In Defence of White Australia\", \"url\": \"https://doi.org/10.1080/1031461X.2014.911761\", \"accessDate\": \"2020-10-19T05:32:16Z\", \"archive\": \"\", \"archiveLocation\": \"\", \"libraryCatalog\": \"Taylor and Francis+NEJM\", \"callNumber\": \"\", \"rights\": \"\", \"extra\": \"Publisher: Routledge\\n_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/1031461X.2014.911761\", \"tags\": [], \"collections\": [\"922CMTJU\"], \"relations\": {}, \"dateAdded\": \"2020-10-20T02:22:30Z\", \"dateModified\": \"2020-10-20T02:22:30Z\", \"oadoi\": \"-\", \"licence\": \"-\", \"oa_type\": \"-\", \"year\": 2014}, {\"DOI\": \"10.1080/1031461X.2014.946523\", \"title\": \"Indigenous Heterogeneity\", \"trove_url\": \"https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/196247551\", \"link_type\": \"notonline\", \"repo_url\": \"https://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/554243\", \"key\": \"NAS55FDF\", \"version\": 15, \"itemType\": \"journalArticle\", \"creators\": [{\"creatorType\": \"author\", \"firstName\": \"Professor Tim\", \"lastName\": \"Rowse\"}], \"abstractNote\": \"In the last twenty years, Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders have more openly articulated different ways of understanding their pasts and futures and the opportunities and obstacles that Australia presents to them.

This article examines transpacific steam from the mid- to the late nineteenth century, a fractured and indeterminate period which nevertheless laid the ground for Australia's sense of itself as an autonomous white nation, relating across the Pacific and within a wider Anglo world beyond Britain and empire.\", \"publicationTitle\": \"Australian Historical Studies\", \"volume\": \"46\", \"issue\": \"3\", \"pages\": \"356-373\", \"date\": \"September 2, 2015\", \"series\": \"\", \"seriesTitle\": \"\", \"seriesText\": \"\", \"journalAbbreviation\": \"\", \"language\": \"\", \"ISSN\": \"1031-461X\", \"shortTitle\": \"Re-Routing Empire?\", \"url\": \"https://doi.org/10.1080/1031461X.2015.1071416\", \"accessDate\": \"2020-10-19T05:35:53Z\", \"archive\": \"\", \"archiveLocation\": \"\", \"libraryCatalog\": \"Taylor and Francis+NEJM\", \"callNumber\": \"\", \"rights\": \"\", \"extra\": \"Publisher: Routledge\\n_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/1031461X.2015.1071416\", \"tags\": [], \"collections\": [\"922CMTJU\"], \"relations\": {}, \"dateAdded\": \"2020-10-20T02:22:30Z\", \"dateModified\": \"2020-10-20T02:22:30Z\", \"oadoi\": \"https://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3174&context=lhapapers\", \"licence\": \"\", \"oa_type\": \"green\", \"year\": 2015}, {\"DOI\": \"10.1080/1031461X.2012.677458\", \"title\": \"Reactions to Australian Colonial Violence in New Guinea: The 1926 Nakanai Massacre in a Global Context\", \"trove_url\": \"https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/201474440\", \"link_type\": \"notonline\", \"repo_url\": \"https://hdl.handle.net/1885/62496\", \"key\": \"6ECWXZQN\", \"version\": 11, \"itemType\": \"journalArticle\", \"creators\": [{\"creatorType\": \"author\", \"firstName\": \"Patricia\", \"lastName\": \"O'Brien\"}], \"abstractNote\": \"On 1 November 1926 an Australian-led force left Rabaul bent on \\u2018justice\\u2019.

More broadly, my aim is to reconsider prevailing views about the relationship between Australian manliness and sentimentality. Birks provides us with an example of Australian manliness that was not based on toughness and anti-sentimentality.

This shift is attributed to the Howard government, the most pro-actively anti-abortion federal government since the early 1970s, and broader white patriarchal discourses of gender that elevated maternity as a moral imperative for women and constructed abortion as a harm.\", \"publicationTitle\": \"Australian Historical Studies\", \"volume\": \"44\", \"issue\": \"2\", \"pages\": \"245-261\", \"date\": \"June 1, 2013\", \"series\": \"\", \"seriesTitle\": \"\", \"seriesText\": \"\", \"journalAbbreviation\": \"\", \"language\": \"\", \"ISSN\": \"1031-461X\", \"shortTitle\": \"Abortion Politics during the Howard Years\", \"url\": \"https://doi.org/10.1080/1031461X.2013.791705\", \"accessDate\": \"2020-10-19T05:22:08Z\", \"archive\": \"\", \"archiveLocation\": \"\", \"libraryCatalog\": \"Taylor and Francis+NEJM\", \"callNumber\": \"\", \"rights\": \"\", \"extra\": \"Publisher: Routledge\\n_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/1031461X.2013.791705\", \"tags\": [], \"collections\": [\"922CMTJU\"], \"relations\": {}, \"dateAdded\": \"2020-10-20T02:22:30Z\", \"dateModified\": \"2020-10-20T02:22:30Z\", \"oadoi\": \"-\", \"licence\": \"-\", \"oa_type\": \"-\", \"year\": 2013}, {\"DOI\": \"10.1080/1031461X.2010.502589\", \"title\": \"Activist Emotions: Gay Radicalism and Melancholic Attachments\", \"trove_url\": \"-\", \"link_type\": \"-\", \"repo_url\": \"-\", \"key\": \"698BQKC5\", \"version\": 6, \"itemType\": \"journalArticle\", \"creators\": [{\"creatorType\": \"author\", \"firstName\": \"Robert\", \"lastName\": \"Reynolds\"}], \"abstractNote\": \"It has been argued recently that Australian historians have overlooked histories of emotion.

While obsessed with expedients to improve the speed and scope of intra-imperial communications and thus facilitate consultation, Hughes was concerned to ensure that Australia played a proper role in arriving at a consensus on the deep common interest that unified Britain and the Dominions. His lack of concern for extending the scope for independent action won by the Dominions during the war, his dismissive remarks regarding the British role in the League of Nations, and the vehemence of his communications with London in 1922, must all be seen within the context of an imperial loyalty that survived the war undiminished.\", \"publicationTitle\": \"Australian Historical Studies\", \"volume\": \"46\", \"issue\": \"1\", \"pages\": \"100-118\", \"date\": \"January 2, 2015\", \"series\": \"\", \"seriesTitle\": \"\", \"seriesText\": \"\", \"journalAbbreviation\": \"\", \"language\": \"\", \"ISSN\": \"1031-461X\", \"shortTitle\": \"William Morris Hughes, Empire and Nationalism\", \"url\": \"https://doi.org/10.1080/1031461X.2014.995114\", \"accessDate\": \"2020-10-19T05:40:14Z\", \"archive\": \"\", \"archiveLocation\": \"\", \"libraryCatalog\": \"Taylor and Francis+NEJM\", \"callNumber\": \"\", \"rights\": \"\", \"extra\": \"Publisher: Routledge\\n_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/1031461X.2014.995114\", \"tags\": [], \"collections\": [\"922CMTJU\"], \"relations\": {}, \"dateAdded\": \"2020-10-20T02:22:30Z\", \"dateModified\": \"2020-10-20T02:22:30Z\", \"oadoi\": \"-\", \"licence\": \"-\", \"oa_type\": \"-\", \"year\": 2015}, {\"DOI\": \"10.1080/1031461X.2012.760630\", \"title\": \"\\u2018Women\\u2014Keep Australia Free!\\u2019: Women Voters and Activists in the 1951 Referendum Campaign\", \"trove_url\": \"-\", \"link_type\": \"-\", \"repo_url\": \"-\", \"key\": \"ATDGYI3X\", \"version\": 15, \"itemType\": \"journalArticle\", \"creators\": [{\"creatorType\": \"author\", \"firstName\": \"Joy\", \"lastName\": \"Damousi\"}], \"abstractNote\": \"This article considers three aspects of the women's vote and activism during the 1951 referendum campaign.

Fiona Bradley from UNSW also [noted that they're shifting to new repository software](https://twitter.com/Fiona_Bradley/status/1319036507244560385), so hopefully that'll fix things.\n",

Again, Richard Orr checked this out and has [implemented a fix in Unpaywall](https://twitter.com/unpaywall_dev/status/1318961609771986944) so the Green OA version should now be indexed. I checked the other two links to NOVA in the data from Trove, but unfortunately those records don't have Green OA versions.\n",
